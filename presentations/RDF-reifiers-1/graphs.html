    <h2>Is a Reifier a Graph?</h2>
    <p>Not per se.
    <p>The triple terms reified are <em>transparent</em>; their constituent subject, predicate and object terms denote entities <em>within the interpretation</em>.
    <p>The reifying purchase is in the same domain of discourse as Alice, the plush lion, the store, and their relationships.

  <section class="slide side right">
    <h2>Triples In The Graph</h2>
    <p>A reifier is not necessarily defined by the triple or triples it reifies. So while a set of the triples reified can be seen as <em>some</em> graph, this does not identify the reifier.
    <p>For example, a purchase is a conceivable concretization of a bought and sold relationship, but it is not intrinsically defined by them. It has other properties, such as a point in time, a location, etc.

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Unlike Graphs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A graph is <em>a set of triples</em>. A graph of one triple is a different entity than one of two, even if the former is a subset of the latter.
      <li>Reifiers have an <code>rdf:reifies</code> relation to each of its triples. (Just as Alice has two parents, not a set of parents.) Each relationship holds individually, monotonically.
    </ul>
    <p>Using OWL, this can be constrained, e.g. on cardinality:
    <pre class="numbered note">
ex:StatementToken rdfs:subClassOf [ a owl:Restriction ;
      owl:onProperty rdf:reifies ;
      owl:cardinality 1 ] .</pre>
    <!--
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">No set is an element of itself</a> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_regularity">axiom of regularity</a> &amp; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_pairing">axiom of pairing</a>).
    -->
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>RDF Named Graphs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A named graph is a <em>pair</em> of a name (IRI or bnode) and a graph (set of triples).
      <li>There is <em>no normatively defined relation</em> between a named graph and the resource denoted by this name.
    </ul>
    <pre class="numbered note">
GRAPH &lt;document> {
  &lt;document> a :Document .
}
</pre>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>An Insulating Gap</h2>
    <p>While the name of a named graph may denote anything, including a reifier, there is no relation from it to the graph, nor to the triples.
    <pre class="numbered note">
&lt;purchase1> a :Purchase ;
  :date "2024-06" .

GRAPH &lt;purchase1> {
  :Alice :bought :LennyTheLion .
  :ToyStore :sold :LennyTheLion .
}</pre>
</pre>
<p>This prevents further modelling of the relationship between the reifier and its reified triples (such as cardinality, ranges or property chain axioms).
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Outside of Graphs</h2>
    <p>Named graphs are for management of graphs in datasets, <em>external to their interpretation(s)</em>.
    <p>There is no normatively defined interpretation for datasets.
    <ul>
      <li>Can be used in practice as a union (see "union default graph" modes of many SPARQL stores, for querying over the union of all graphs in a dataset).
      <li>Or as separate, isolated interpretations (e.g. Verifiable Credentials).
    </ul>
    <p>(See also the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-datasets/">RDF 1.1: On Semantics of RDF Datasets</a> note.)
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Reifiers Unify Usage Patterns</h2>
    <p>The domain of <code>rdf:reifies</code> is open (of any type). Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>A token in a source document (classic reification <code>rdf:Statement</code>).
      <li>An utterance or linguistic expression encoded as multiple related triples ("a person named Alice Liddell").
      <li>A source message or document ("T indicates that A bought B from C").
      <li>A circumstance or event (a Collaboration, a Purchase, etc.).
    </ul>
    <p>This unifies the earlier dichotomy between classic reification and "that which named graph names may denote".
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>A Note About Abstract Graphs</h2>
    <p>The graph itself&mdash;as a mathematical set of triples&mdash;is reasonably not a concretization of itself.
    <p>It <i>is</i> a set of abstract triples.
    <p>Triple terms <i>may</i> play a role in defining such. Cf. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/">Notation 3</a>.
